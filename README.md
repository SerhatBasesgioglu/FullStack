This is a full stack application to learn/show off all required technologies for a fullstack developer, it will be mainly focused on backend technologies.

Backend

Backend will start as a monolith application, later on some of the services will be turned into microservices. Monolith will be on a vm, microservices will be on containers.
System will be hosted on AWS.

TODO

Find a proper idea to implement most of the enterprise level technologies on a small scale. It requires:

More than 3-4 services (for implementing microservices)
Real time connection (for websockets)
High amount of data (for learning query optimization and caching strategies)
Interesting idea with imporovability.
